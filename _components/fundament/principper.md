    <h2>Make the best thing the easiest thing.</h2>
    <p>The U.S. Web Design Standards is the easiest path for teams around the federal government to comply with the latest federal policy for websites and digital services. The Standards support modern web development practices, such as mobile first and responsive frameworks. By offering open-source, quick-to-download code and assets, the Standards make it easy to deliver the highest-quality government websites to the public.</p>

  <div class="width-one-half">
    <h2>Offer accessibility out of the box.</h2>
    <p>Every asset we offer should meet the high accessibility standards outlined in Section 508. For teams that need to customize the Standards to meet their agency needs, guidance will be offered to ensure any extensions and customizations that are made comply with Section 508 guidelines.</p>

    <h2>Design for flexibility.</h2>
    <p>Our patterns and designs are easy to adapt to support the diverse scope and needs of government digital services. The tools and components provided in the Standards are focused on performance, both from a technical and team based point of view. To ensure this, everything should be validated for the user by the user. The Standards wants to empower teams across to government to make the statement “good enough for government work” mean something again.</p>

    <h2>Showcase benefits for agency and users.</h2>
    <p>Teams around the government should easily be able to find inspiration from among their peers. This inspiration can jumpstart many teams own efforts but also lay the groundwork for making the business case for adopting the U.S. Web Design Standards. We will catalog the successes of the Standards and its users both quantitatively and qualitatively.</p>

    <h2>Reuse, reuse, reuse.</h2>
    <p>Teams should not be burdened with recreating basic components and patterns for every new product they create. The tools, patterns, and components present in the Standards will be a comprehensive collection of tried-and-true assets that reflect industry best practices. This will enable teams to focus on the unique aspects of their product to ensure the general public is getting the best possible service.</p>
