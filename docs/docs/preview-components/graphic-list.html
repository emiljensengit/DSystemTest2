<meta name="description" content="Graphic headings can vary.
        Graphic headings can be used a few different ways, depending on what your landing page is for. Highlight your values, specific program areas, or results.
      
    
    
      
      
        Stick to 6 or fewer words.
        Keep body text to about 30. They can be shorter, but try to be somewhat balanced across all four. It creates a clean appearance with good spacing.
      
    
  
  
    
      
      
        Never highlight anything without a goal.
        For anything you want to highlight here, understand what your users know now, and what activity or impression you want from them after they see it.
      
    
    
      
      
        Could also have 2 or 6.
        In addition to your goal, find out your users’ goals. What do they want to know or do that supports your mission? Use these headings to show those.">
